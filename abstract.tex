A demonstration agricultural microgrid containing PV, battery energy storage (BSS) and multiple water pumps is presented.
A mathematical model of the cost of operating the microgrid is developed, including modeling of battery charging modes and hybrid inverter source selection.
The mathematical model is implemented in Python using Pyomo and optimized to plan pumping and water usage.
The model may serve as the basis for model predictive control (MPC) or stochastic model predictive control (SMPC).
