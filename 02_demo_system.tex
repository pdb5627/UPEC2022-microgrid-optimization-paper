\section{Demonstration System}
\label{sec:demo-system}

The optimization problem is specifically formulated for a demonstration system to be installed at the Güneşköy farm\cite{Guneskoy}. A block diagram of the demonstration system with anticipated component ratings is shown in \cref{fig:demo-system}.

The existing pump will continue to be fed from the grid. The site electrical load will be fed from a hybrid inverter\cite{INVT_manual} that will have battery, PV, and grid connections available. A new pump load will be fed from an inverter drive\cite{Growatt_manual} connected to the PV DC bus.
