The optimization run reduced the cost of the objective function from the initialized value of of \num{4127.3} to an optimized value of \num{3073.8}. The components of the initialized and optimized objective function costs are shown in \cref{table:optimal-costs}.

\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:pv-side-power} shows the power on the PV and BSS side of the microgrid.
Due to the relative ratings of the PV array, Pump 2, and the BSS, on the sunny days (24 and 26 February), the full available PV power is not able to be used.

	\label{fig:bss-energy}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:grid-side-power} shows the power on the grid side of the microgrid.
On the first day (24 February), the hybrid inverter switches over to the grid because the BSS stored energy, shown in \cref{fig:bss-energy}, is depleted before load can be met by power from the PV array, but once the BSS is recharged by PV during the day, the hybrid inverter switches back to the PV/BSS source and is able to supply the load for the rest of the modeled period.
The largest load on the grid is Pump 1, which optimally runs during the nighttime hours where time of day electrical rates are cheapest.

	\label{fig:bss-power}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:bss-power} shows the charging and discharging power to the BSS.
As one would expect, it follows a pattern of charging during the part of the day in which PV energy is available and discharging to meet load during the dark period.

	\label{fig:water-used}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:water-level} shows the water level in the two reservoirs while \cref{fig:water-used} shows the water usage from each reservoir throughout the day.
Since the efficiency of water usage is highest at night, the optimal operation releases water during the nighttime hours.
