abstract = {Balancing the energy demand in isolated microgrids is a critical issue especially in the presence of intermittent energy sources. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) can be installed in such circumstances to supply the demand and support the reserve requirements of the isolated microgrid. However, due to the high installation costs of BESS, there is a need for proper mechanisms to select such systems and size them optimally. Furthermore, since BESS are often installed to serve multiple applications, these should be properly modeled to coordinate their different functionalities. In this thesis, a multi-year operational planning model is developed to determine the BESS optimal power rating and energy capacity along with the year of installation taking into account its coordinated operation. The model includes unit commitment formulation with renewable energy and BESS operational constraints. The optimal planning decisions are obtained for different BESS technologies under several scenarios of ownerships. The uncertain patterns of solar and wind resources and system demand are considered and several microgrid operational scenarios are created. A stochastic optimization model is developed to determine the optimal BESS size and installation year including the different states of the uncertain microgrid variables. The stochastic optimization model is solved using a decomposition based two-stage iterative approach to cope with the large computational burden of such problems.},

abstract = {Diesel-powered pumps are widely employed in farming and grassland irrigation. However, there can be problems of reliability and availability where fuel supply is erratic and expensive, high maintenance cost, and short life expectancy. These and recent concerns for the environment associated with the diesel engines call for a viable alternative source of power for irrigational water pumping. Renewable energy sources have gained a lot of attention as a replacement for fossil fuels or as a supplement in hybrid systems. Solar-powered (photovoltaic) systems are one of the viable alternatives that have attracted considerable attention in this regard. They have been deployed in many remote regions for various applications, ranging from rural electrification and community water supplies to irrigation and livestock water supplies. Although photovoltaic (PV) systems generally have a high investment cost, it has many features which make it attractive as an alternative source of power for water pumping. It is clean, as it produces no carbon emission, it generates no noise, and it has low operational and maintenance cost. This manuscript presents a detailed intensive review of solar-powered water pumping systems as reported in the literature to serve as a quick reference to researchers and engineers who are working or interested in the subject.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new coordination framework to optimize the joint operation of pumped-storage unit, irrigation system and intermittent wind power generation in an agricultural microgrid. The microgrid is an agricultural complex connected to the medium voltage network. This complex contains a farm needing water to be irrigated every day. The irrigation system has two large scale reservoirs located in different levels. These reservoirs have been planned to act as pumped-storage unit reservoirs. The microgrid contains different electrical loads such as industrial livestock, agricultural products packaging factory, drip irrigation system, lighting and other small loads. The microgrid is connected to the upstream network at the grid supply point (GSP) and supplies loads with power from the upstream network and a wind power unit located in the farm. The proposed framework optimizes day-ahead (DA) scheduling of power exchange with the upstream network, pumped-storage unit and irrigation system based on forecasted wind power, microgrid load demand and water needed for irrigation in a market environment. The two-point estimate method (TPEM) is implemented to model the uncertainties associated with wind power and wholesale market prices. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated on several case studies.},

abstract = {Access to electric power supply has always had a significant role in promoting improvements in all the society sectors, nevertheless nowadays 1.3 billion of people still do not have electricity access. Moreover, most of them live in rural areas of developing countries which are often isolated, scattered populated and characterized by poor infrastructure and services. In this situation, the growing consideration towards the target of universal access to energy has emphasized the role of rural electrification, and off-grid small-scale generation represents one of the most appropriate options. As a consequence, the scientific literature has devoted attention to this topic with a large number of papers. In this frame, the present analysis focuses on off-grid systems for rural electrification and provides a general framework to this topic and an analytical review of the literature. The work is based on the review of more than 350 papers mainly published from 2000 to 2014 within selected journals, and it is organized in two sections. In the first one we describe the role of small-scale generation systems throughout the process of electrification, the main features of rural areas and their typical energy uses, and we propose a new comprehensive taxonomy for off-grid systems for rural electrification. In the second one we develop an extensive review of the selected literature according to the proposed classification and to five main research areas: Technology: layout and components; Models and methods for simulation and sizing; Techno-economic feasibility analyses and sustainability analyses; Case studies analyses; Policy analyses. The work results in a comprehensive review which organizes and capitalizes the main fundamentals of the addressed topic and provides elements to get acquainted with the literature.},

Two main types of PV irrigation systems can be distinguished, and a comprehensive discussion on their advantages and disadvantages is done in this chapter. The most common PV irrigation type is the system that pumps water to an elevated reservoir (source-pump-reservoir). This type of installation makes it possible to store water and energy, thus increasing the supply reliability. The second type is the irrigation system that pumps water directly to the distribution network (source-pump-crop). In this kind of system, water is withdrawn from the water source and then directly distributed to the plant emitters in a single pumping stage. This chapter focuses mainly on discussing the design principles of these PV irrigation systems.

abstract = {Due to high investment and maintenance costs, the government on Bangladesh is unable to provide sufficient support for grid extension and supplying electricity to remote or rural areas. The deficit in electricity introduces a crisis in powering irrigation systems, which influences negatively the country's dominant income-generating sector, agriculture. Islanded microgrids with solar photovoltaic (PV) cells is one of the most attractive solutions for providing power to rural areas due to their cost-effectiveness, reliability and environment-friendly attributes. Therefore, a techno-economic feasibility study has been undertaken to investigate the prospects of renewable energy-based islanded microgrids to support rural electrification to power both households and irrigation systems. Three case studies based on the operation time of irrigation pumps during the day are developed using the HOMER Pro Microgrid Analysis Tool to identify the optimised configurations for the proposed system. The optimised configurations are then assessed considering the performance matrices of the cost of electricity (COE), net present cost (NPC), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and renewable energy fraction (RF). From the analyses, it is perceived that the operation of irrigation pumps at different times of a day is a significant influence, and the optimum method considering techno-economical evaluation is to run the irrigation pumps during the daytime by solar PV. It is evident that the proposed islanded microgrid has significant potentialities in powering irrigation systems as well as rural electrification with low energy generation costs, a contribution to the reduction of global warming and to ameliorating the energy crisis in Bangladesh in order to achieve a sustainable future.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop optimization and control methods for a grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) storage system. The storage component consists of two separate units, a large slower moving unit for energy shifting and arbitrage and a small rapid charging unit for smoothing. We use a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to allow the units to automatically and dynamically adapt to changes in PV output while responding to external system operator requests or price signals. At each time step, the system is modeled using convex objectives and constraints and solved to obtain a control schedule for the storage units across the MPC horizon. For each subsequent time step, the first step of the schedule is executed before repeating the optimization process to account for changes in the operating environment and predictions due to availability of additional information. We present simulation results that demonstrate the ability of this optimization framework to respond dynamically in real time to external price signals and provide increased system benefits including smoother power output while respecting and maintaining the functional requirements of the storage units and power converters. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},
annote = {BESS with multiple components (high power component, high capacity component). Model predictive control (MPC). Includes objective to account for effects in "lifetime and functionality" of BESS. Has a real-time energy price component (arbitrage), a net output smoothing component, and a cycling/BESS output smoothing component as well as a regularization term to make the control output smoother.},
