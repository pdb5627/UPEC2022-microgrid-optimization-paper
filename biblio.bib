   abstract = {The impedance model is widely used for analyzing power converters. However, the output impedance is an external representation of a converter system, i.e., it compresses the entire dynamics into a single transfer function with internal details of the interaction between states hidden. As a result, there are no programmatic routines to link each control parameter to the system dynamic modes and to show the interactions among them, which makes the designers rely on their experience and heuristic to interpret the impedance model and its implications. To overcome these obstacles, this article proposes a new modeling tool named as impedance circuit model, visualizing the closed-loop power converter as an impedance circuit with discrete circuit elements rather than an all-in-one impedance transfer function. It can reveal the virtual impedance essence of all control parameters at different impedance locations and/or within different frequency bandwidths, and show their interactions and coupling effects. A grid-forming voltage source inverter is investigated as an example, with considering its voltage controller, current controller, control delay, voltage/current \{\$\}dq\{\$\}-frame cross-decoupling terms, output-voltage/current feedforward control, droop controllers, and three typical virtual impedances. The proposed modeling tool is validated by frequency-domain spectrum measurement and time-domain step response in simulations and experiments.},

   abstract = {Increasing inverter-based sources reduces the system's inertia resulting in possible frequency stability issues. Understanding low-inertia systems and their stability properties is of crucial importance. This article introduces fundamental ways to integrate high levels of renewable energy (RE) and distributed energy resources (DERs) in the power system while creating a more flexible power system. Using RE and DER in the distribution system has many advantages such as reducing the physical and electrical distance between generation and loads, bringing sources closer to loads contributes to the enhancement of the voltage profile, reduction in distribution and transmission bottlenecks, improved reliability, lower losses, and enhances the potential use of waste heat. A basic issue for high penetration of DER is the technical complexity of controlling hundreds of thousands to millions of inverters. This is addressed through autonomous techniques using local measurements eliminating the need for fast control systems. The key issues addressed in this article include using inverter damping to stabilize frequency in systems with low or no inertia, autonomous operation, methods for relieving inverter overload, energy reserves, and their implementation in photovoltaics (PV) systems. This article provides important insight into the interactions between inverter bases sources and the high-power system. The distinction between grid-forming (GFM) inverter and grid-following (GFL) inverter is profound. GFM inverters provide damping to frequency swings in a mixed system, while GFL inverter can aggravate frequency problems with increased penetration. Rather than acting as a source of inertia, the GFM inverter acts as a source of damping to the system. On the other hand, the application of inverters in the power system has two major issues. One is the complexity of controlling hundreds of thousands to millions of inverters. This is addressed through autonomous techniques using local measurements. The other is the potential of high overcurrent in GFM inverters and techniques for explicitly protecting against overloading. To exploit the innate damping of GFM inverters, energy reserves are critical.},

Since almost all real clocks exhibit drifts, this applies in particular to networks composed of several individual units, each of which being operated with its individual clock. In the present paper, we demonstrate via extensive experiments on a microgrid in the megawatt range that clock drifts may impair frequency synchronization in low-inertia power systems. The experiments also show that-in the absence of a common clock-the standard model of an inverter as an ideal voltage source does not capture this phenomenon. As a consequence, we derive a suitably modified model of an inverter-interfaced unit that incorporates the phenomenon of clock drifts. By using the derived model, we investigate the effects of clock drifts on the performance of droop-controlled grid-forming inverters with regard to frequency synchronization and active power sharing. The modeling and analysis is validated via extensive experiments on a microgrid in the megawatt range.},

   abstract = {Due to its multiple advantages, the grid-forming, droop-controlled (GFDC) inverter is a strong contender for large-scale deployment in the future power systems. However, it is still unclear whether higher harmonics can play an important role in the dynamics of GFDC inverter networks. The major objective of this article is to gain insight into whether certain higher harmonics influence or interact with GFDC inverter network dynamics and to characterize this harmonic interaction. For this purpose, a multiple-harmonic dynamic phasor model (DPM) of a representative GFDC network is derived, which can be conveniently extended to hundreds of DPM equations in order to rigorously investigate the effects of dc offsets and/or second-harmonic content, six-step switching harmonics, and unbalance. For a representative network, the results from eigenvalue migration studies show that GFDC dynamics are not strongly influenced by the presence of six-step switching harmonics nor unbalance. For the first time, it is shown that under conditions of high droop slope and high-bandwidth power filtering, dc offsets and second-harmonic content can excite a resonance within the network and even influence the location of the eigenvalues of the linearized DPM. All DPM results are thoroughly validated using Simulink, and the selected results are validated experimentally using the Wisconsin Energy Institute (WEI) microgrid testbed.},

   abstract = {Modern power grids include a variety of renewable Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) as a strategy to comply with new environmental and renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) imposed by state and federal agencies. Typically, DERs include the use of power electronic (PE) interfaces to interactwith the power grid. Recently this interaction has not only been focused on supplying maximum available energy, but also on supporting the power grid under abnormal conditions such as low voltage/frequency conditions or non-unity power factor. Over the last few years, grid-following inverters (GFLIs) have proven their value while providing these ancillary grid-support services either at residential or utility scale. However, the use of grid-forming inverters (GFMIs) is gaining momentum as the penetration-level of DERs increases and system inertia decreases. Under abnormal operating conditions, GFMIs tend to better preserve grid stability due to their intrinsic ability to balance loadswithout the aid of coordination controls. In order to gain and propose fundamental insights into the interfacing of GFMIs to real time simulation, this paper analyzes the dynamics of two different GFMI simulation models in terms of stability and load changes using a Power Hardware-in-the-Loop (PHIL) simulation testbed.},

As compared with conventional grid-feeding power converters, grid-forming power converters, i.e. the ones controlled as ac voltage sources, are more promising owing to their capabilities of voltage and frequency regulation. As such, this paper explores the possibility of inertia emulation by grid-forming power converters. Through the stability analysis, it is revealed that the instability issue is associated with typical virtual inertia control. Further, a lead-lag compensator is introduced to resolve this issue.

Since the fault response of inverters is significantly different from that of synchronous generators, their equivalent sequence models must differ as well. While the sequence models of synchronous generators are well-known and verified, practical sequence models of inverters remain an area of research. This manuscript addresses the modeling of grid-forming inverters in the sequence domain where the focus is on three-leg three-phase inverters. To generalize the analysis, two different control strategies used with grid-forming inverters are considered. The equivalent sequence models of these inverters with both strategies are discussed in detail and numerical simulations are used to further clarify the analysis. It is observed that grid-forming inverters with different types of control strategies show a consistent behavior in the positive-sequence circuit during faults for a given voltage drop. Conversely, the negative-sequence model of grid-forming inverters is heavily influenced by the control strategy. The analysis and results are useful to develop reliable protection schemes in inverter-based grids, as understanding the characteristics of electrical elements in the sequence domain is essential for any protective function.},

Grid-forming converters set the frequency and voltage of the grid and enable its operation under constant frequency, thus creating a new paradigm for the frequency response of a power system. Power sharing between converters is addressed while assessing the implications of operating the bulk power system at a constant frequency. Case studies performed on a small 9-bus system as well as a large 2000-bus system, using a developed positive sequence as well as a detailed three-phase point on wave models of a grid forming converter are discussed.},

   abstract = {Grid-forming (GFM) inverter control techniques are attracting increased attention for interconnecting inverter-based resources (IBRs) to the electric grid because of their demonstrated performance advantages over existing grid-following (GFL) IBRs in weak system scenarios and low-inertia power systems. GFL inverters require a stiff voltage and frequency source for their operation. In contrast, GFM inverters can independently control both voltage and frequency. However, due to their inherent behavior as voltage sources, GFM inverters do not naturally possess the ability to limit fault current during grid transients such as short circuit faults. In this work, a virtual impedance-based fault current limiting approach is presented for droop-controlled grid-forming inverters. This approach has been tested and validated using electromagnetic transient simulations. A transient stability model of the GFM inverter has been developed and used to study the performance of the IEEE 2 Area system with GFM inverters displacing traditional generators. The results of this study demonstrate that GFM inverters can successfully restrain fault currents within allowed limits while retaining their original stability characteristics.},

The premise of VOC is to modulate inverter dynamics to emulate those of nonlinear oscillators with the goal of realizing a stable ac microgrid in the absence of communication, synchronous generation, or a stiff grid. To obtain a reduced-order model for a system of parallel-connected inverters with VOC, we first formulate a set of scaling laws that describe how the controller and filter parameters of a given inverter depend on its voltage and power rating. Subsequently, we show that N parallel inverters which adhere to this scaling law can be modeled with the same structure and hence the same computational burden of the model of a single inverter. The proposed aggregate model is experimentally validated on a system of three parallel inverters with heterogeneous power ratings.},

Attention is focused on constructing reduced-order models that accurately predict the nonlinear behavior of coherent clusters of droop-controlled inverters in response to a large disturbance, such as an asymmetric fault. In such a scenario, dynamic phasor models are shown to offer valuable insights into how the signal conditioning associated with local power measurement can have a significant effect on the large-signal stability of a droop-controlled inverter or inverter cluster. An algorithm conventionally used to identify coherent groups of synchronous generators is adopted for the investigation of coherency between large numbers of droop-controlled inverters within a distribution network. The coherency results help guide the aggregation of droop-controlled inverters and enable nonlinear reduced-order dynamic phasor modeling. For large disturbances, a reduced-order dynamic phasor simulation of a 50-inverter system is validated against full-order simulation results obtained using an OPAL-RT power system simulator.},

   abstract = {Alternate sources of energy such as wind, solar photovoltaic and fuel cells are coupled to the power grid with the help of solid state converters. Continued deregulation of the power sector coupled with favorable government incentives has resulted in the rapid growth of renewable energy sources connected to the distribution system at a voltage level of 34.5kV or below. Of late, many utilities are also investing in these alternate sources of energy with the point of interconnection with the power grid being at the transmission level. These converter interfaced generation along with their associated control have the ability to provide the advantage of fast control of frequency, voltage, active, and reactive power. However, their ability to provide stability in a large system is yet to be investigated in detail. This is the primary objective of this research. In the future, along with an increase in the percentage of converter interfaced renewable energy sources connected to the transmission network, there exists a possibility of even connecting synchronous machines to the grid through converters. Thus, all sources of energy can be expected to be coupled to the grid through converters. The control and operation of such a grid will be unlike anything that has been encountered till now. In this dissertation, the operation and behavior of such a grid will be investigated. The first step in such an analysis will be to build an accurate and simple mathematical model to represent the corresponding components in commercial software. Once this bridge has been crossed, conventional machines will be replaced with their solid state interfaced counterparts in a phased manner. At each stage, attention will be devoted to the control of these sources and also on the stability performance of the large power system. This dissertation addresses various concerns regarding the control and operation of a futuristic power grid. In addition, this dissertation also aims to address the issue of whether a requirement may arise to redefine operational reliability criteria based on the results obtained.},

Recent work carried out by the authors has proven that for DQCI converter-interfaced sources there are overall penetration limits, i.e. the 'tipping points' beyond which the system will become unstable. Initial investigations of this "tipping point", based on a reduced model of the transmission system of Great Britain using phasor simulation within DIgSILENT PowerFactory, are reviewed briefly in this paper. The 'tipping points' relating to maximum penetration of DQCI converter-interfaced sources are subsequently investigated in this paper using a higher fidelity three-phase dynamic power system model in Matlab Simulink. Additionally, a new converter controller, termed here as Virtual Synchronous Machine Zero Inertia (VSM0H), is described and implemented in the model. It is shown that, in principle, it is possible to significantly increase the penetration of converter based generation (up to 100% of installed capacity) without reaching a stability constraint.},

   abstract = {For years, grid phenomena such as voltage stability, loss of inertia, voltage dips, etc. have been managed by well established solutions. Such solutions include on load tap changing transformers, and synchronous generators. Now, the increased penetration of load and generation interfaced by converter based systems has demanded changes in the way the grid is managed. If the aforementioned issues are not considered, local instability can lead to system-wide instability. One possible solution for the majority of these issues is to change the control logic of the converter, modifying it from the standard vectorial output current theory (DQCl control) to one where the traditional synchronous generator is emulated. These solutions are based within the so called Virtual Synchronous Machine or VSM algorithms. Among them, the so-called Virtual Synchronous Machine Zero Inertia (VSM0H) has been implemented in this paper. Due to its simplicity and efficacy, it has been chosen for experimental testing and analysis. The process to implement the VSM0H algorithm in the lab will be explained; with particular emphasis in the connection process since, with the VSM0H algorithm, the converter becomes a true voltage source, and this procedure can be particularly challenging. An explanation of the blocks added to provide this soft connection will be explained. Additionally, another experiment showing the behavior of the system against changes in the power references will be shown.},

In order to design the solar irrigation system based on groundwater, equations for analyzing the optimum irrigation amount were developed in this study, and the main steps to design the system were also given. The coefficients and parameters in the equations are related to meteorological factors, vegetation types and areas, and soil properties. The soil water content is a control variable to decide the water irrigation amount for its effects on maintaining the vegetation growth based on soil water evaporation, plant transpiration and physiological consumption. According to the pasture restoring objectives and water demands during the plants growing periods, proper soil water contents are chosen as evaluation basis for irrigation. The groundwater system should be kept healthy during exploitation; so, the possible supply of local groundwater is a constraint condition in the model. Besides, an optimum irrigation amount process in a whole year is provided for the solar powered system design. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The exploitation of solar energy in remote areas through photovoltaic (PV) systems is an attractive solution for water pumping for irrigation systems. The design of a photovoltaic water pumping system (PVWPS) strictly depends on the estimation of the crop water requirements and land use since the water demand varies during the watering season and the solar irradiation changes time by time. It is of significance to conduct dynamic simulations in order to achieve the successful and optimal design. The aim of this paper is to develop a dynamic modelling tool for the design of a of photovoltaic water pumping system by combining the models of the water demand, the solar PV power and the pumping system, which can be used to validate the design procedure in terms of matching between water demand and water supply. Both alternate current (AC) and direct current (DC) pumps and both fixed and two-axis tracking PV array were analyzed. The tool has been applied in a case study. Results show that it has the ability to do rapid design and optimization of PV water pumping system by reducing the power peak and selecting the proper devices from both technical and economic viewpoints. Among the different alternatives considered in this study, the AC fixed system represented the best cost effective solution. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) water pumping system has been proved being environmental-friendly and low energy-cost, which has a promising prospect in arid areas which are rich in solar energy resources. However, water resources remain to be one of the main restraints to the application of PV water pumping system widely. Models to evaluate the evapotranspiration and groundwater level in the well are estimated based on the data of a field trip, which was conducted in Wulanchabu grassland, Inner Mongolia, China. Data about the performance of the PV water pumping system, including evapotranspiration and the groundwater level variation were collected. In this paper, evapotranspiration is calculated by Penman-Monteith method and Theis formula is introduced to calculate the soil characters and simulate the groundwater level variation. PRMSE and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency are used to validate the model performance with the collected lysimeter data and groundwater level. The results show that the modeling of the evapotranspiration and groundwater level is reliable. According to the water demand and energy demand, the method to optimize the pumping system is introduced. Based on the calculated result and collected data of water demand and groundwater level, groundwater in the site is abundant to support the system. However, due to the stickiness of the soil condition, the recharge rate is smaller than the pumping rate. According to the comparison, the current system is oversized. In this condition, the pump would run out of water, and have to stop pumping. Therefore, not only the water quantity is an important factor to be considered, the soil condition and recharge rate are also of great significance to the optimization of photovoltaic water pumping systems.},

We describe the dynamics, implementation, and operation of synchronverters. The real and reactive power delivered by synchronverters connected in parallel and operated as generators can be automatically shared using the well-known frequency- and voltage-drooping mechanisms.

   abstract = {The character of modern power systems is changing rapidly and inverters are taking over a considerable part of the energy generation. A future purely inverter-based grid could be a viable solution, if its technical feasibility can be first validated. The focus of this work lies on inverter dominated microgrids, which are also mentioned as 'hybrid' in several instances throughout the thesis. Hybrid, as far as the energy input of each generator is concerned. Conventional fossil fuel based generators are connected in parallel to renewable energy sources as well as battery systems. The main contributions of this work comprise of: The analysis of detailed models and control structures of grid inverters, synchronous generators and battery packs and the utilization of these models to formulate control strategies for distributed generators. The developed strategies accomplish objectives in a wide time scale, from maintaining stability during faults and synchronization transients as well as optimizing load flow through communication-free distributed control.},

   abstract = {The number of grid-tied inverters interfacing renewable resources, energy-storage devices, and flexible loads in distribution networks is steadily increasing. State-space models for inverters are nonlinear and high dimensional which renders the task of modeling large numbers at the edge of the grid to be a difficult undertaking. To address this issue, we develop a distribution-network-cognizant aggregation approach that describes the collective dynamics of grid-tied three-phase inverters. Inverters are clustered based on effective impedances to an infinite bus (modeling the transmission-distribution boundary) and for each cluster, an aggregate dynamical model is developed to preserve the structure and order of each individual inverter state-space model. The K-means algorithm is leveraged for clustering and a suitable linearization of the power-flow equations reduces computational burden involved in determining terminal voltages for the clusters. Numerical simulation results for the IEEE 37-bus feeder system demonstrate the accuracy and computational benefits of the proposed aggregation method.},

   abstract = {This paper contributes to the field of inverter modelling for large-scale simulations by introducing a novel Model-Order Reduction (MOR) method based on singular perturbation. Motivated by the timescale separation between the fast and slow dynamics in an inverter-based power system, the proposed nonlinear MOR concept extends on the existing zero- and first-order reduction methods by combining the low computational burden of the former approach with the higher accuracy of the latter one. As a result, such hybrid MOR technique preserves the slow system dynamics of the full-order model, while simultaneously capturing the impact of the removed fast states on slow variables. Moreover, we introduce several improvements to the existing first-order MOR in order to make it tractable and more efficient when applied to a realistic full-order inverter model. The novel hybrid approach is applied to both grid-forming and grid-following inverter control schemes, and compared against existing reduction methods from the literature. The results showcase a better time-domain performance of the hybrid method during transients, while having a negligible increase in computational requirements compared to the traditional zero-order approach.},

   abstract = {Due to the fast growth of photovoltaic (PV) installations, concerns are rising about the harmonic distortion generated from PV inverters. High current total harmonic distortion (THD) occurs when PV inverters operate under light load conditions due to low solar insolation. A general model modified from the conventional control structure diagram is introduced to analyze the harmonic formation process. Causes of the current harmonics are summarized and its relationship with output power levels is analyzed. The field measurement for current harmonics is carried out at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) microgrid to validate the analysis results. In particular for two-stage inverter, unlike previous papers that assume the DC-link voltage is constant, the DC-link voltage ripple is identified as the source of a series of odd harmonics. A mew periodic time-varying model is proposed by including the DC-link voltage ripple into the conventional current control loop model. This model is able to simulate the characteristics of the harmonic components and show their dependence on the DC-link voltage ripple. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

It is expected that with increasing shares of inverter-based electrical power generation, grid-forming inverters will also become relevant for interconnected power systems. In contrast to conventional current-controlled inverters, grid-forming inverters do not immediately follow the grid voltage. They form voltage phasors that have an inertial behavior.

Since almost all real clocks exhibit drifts, this applies in particular to networks composed of several individual units, each of which being operated with its individual clock. In the present paper, we demonstrate via extensive experiments on a microgrid in the megawatt range that clock drifts may impair frequency synchronization in low-inertia power systems. The experiments also show that-in the absence of a common clock-the standard model of an inverter as an ideal voltage source does not capture this phenomenon. As a consequence, we derive a suitably modified model of an inverter-interfaced unit that incorporates the phenomenon of clock drifts. By using the derived model, we investigate the effects of clock drifts on the performance of droop-controlled grid-forming inverters with regard to frequency synchronization and active power sharing. The modeling and analysis is validated via extensive experiments on a microgrid in the megawatt range.},

The autonomous operation of a microgrid is quite challenging, considering the fact the interfacing inverters are expected to regulate the islanded system's voltage and frequency. Providentially a grid forming control of the interfacing power electronic inverters has proven to help regulate the frequency and voltage. However, with the dynamic nature of typical electrical loads, it is imperative to develop a robust control system that dynamically adjusts to the changing grid load condition. Consequently, a grid supporting control for the inverter-based microgrid can play a more active role in frequency and voltage regulation under dynamic loading conditions. In this work, a grid supporting control, which makes the inverter-based microgrid to operate as a voltage source, is proposed and analyzed under a changing load. The grid supporting scheme implements droop and virtual output impedance control, which dynamically modify their operating parameter according to microgrid conditions. The performance of this control is evaluated based on its ability to improve the voltage and frequency control in autonomous mode.},

   abstract = {Modern power grids include a variety of renewable Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) as a strategy to comply with new environmental and renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) imposed by state and federal agencies. Typically, DERs include the use of power electronic (PE) interfaces to interactwith the power grid. Recently this interaction has not only been focused on supplying maximum available energy, but also on supporting the power grid under abnormal conditions such as low voltage/frequency conditions or non-unity power factor. Over the last few years, grid-following inverters (GFLIs) have proven their value while providing these ancillary grid-support services either at residential or utility scale. However, the use of grid-forming inverters (GFMIs) is gaining momentum as the penetration-level of DERs increases and system inertia decreases. Under abnormal operating conditions, GFMIs tend to better preserve grid stability due to their intrinsic ability to balance loadswithout the aid of coordination controls. In order to gain and propose fundamental insights into the interfacing of GFMIs to real time simulation, this paper analyzes the dynamics of two different GFMI simulation models in terms of stability and load changes using a Power Hardware-in-the-Loop (PHIL) simulation testbed.},

   abstract = {Due to its multiple advantages, the grid-forming, droop-controlled (GFDC) inverter is a strong contender for large-scale deployment in the future power systems. However, it is still unclear whether higher harmonics can play an important role in the dynamics of GFDC inverter networks. The major objective of this article is to gain insight into whether certain higher harmonics influence or interact with GFDC inverter network dynamics and to characterize this harmonic interaction. For this purpose, a multiple-harmonic dynamic phasor model (DPM) of a representative GFDC network is derived, which can be conveniently extended to hundreds of DPM equations in order to rigorously investigate the effects of dc offsets and/or second-harmonic content, six-step switching harmonics, and unbalance. For a representative network, the results from eigenvalue migration studies show that GFDC dynamics are not strongly influenced by the presence of six-step switching harmonics nor unbalance. For the first time, it is shown that under conditions of high droop slope and high-bandwidth power filtering, dc offsets and second-harmonic content can excite a resonance within the network and even influence the location of the eigenvalues of the linearized DPM. All DPM results are thoroughly validated using Simulink, and the selected results are validated experimentally using the Wisconsin Energy Institute (WEI) microgrid testbed.},

   abstract = {Increasing inverter-based sources reduces the system's inertia resulting in possible frequency stability issues. Understanding low-inertia systems and their stability properties is of crucial importance. This article introduces fundamental ways to integrate high levels of renewable energy (RE) and distributed energy resources (DERs) in the power system while creating a more flexible power system. Using RE and DER in the distribution system has many advantages such as reducing the physical and electrical distance between generation and loads, bringing sources closer to loads contributes to the enhancement of the voltage profile, reduction in distribution and transmission bottlenecks, improved reliability, lower losses, and enhances the potential use of waste heat. A basic issue for high penetration of DER is the technical complexity of controlling hundreds of thousands to millions of inverters. This is addressed through autonomous techniques using local measurements eliminating the need for fast control systems. The key issues addressed in this article include using inverter damping to stabilize frequency in systems with low or no inertia, autonomous operation, methods for relieving inverter overload, energy reserves, and their implementation in photovoltaics (PV) systems. This article provides important insight into the interactions between inverter bases sources and the high-power system. The distinction between grid-forming (GFM) inverter and grid-following (GFL) inverter is profound. GFM inverters provide damping to frequency swings in a mixed system, while GFL inverter can aggravate frequency problems with increased penetration. Rather than acting as a source of inertia, the GFM inverter acts as a source of damping to the system. On the other hand, the application of inverters in the power system has two major issues. One is the complexity of controlling hundreds of thousands to millions of inverters. This is addressed through autonomous techniques using local measurements. The other is the potential of high overcurrent in GFM inverters and techniques for explicitly protecting against overloading. To exploit the innate damping of GFM inverters, energy reserves are critical.},

Since the fault response of inverters is significantly different from that of synchronous generators, their equivalent sequence models must differ as well. While the sequence models of synchronous generators are well-known and verified, practical sequence models of inverters remain an area of research. This manuscript addresses the modeling of grid-forming inverters in the sequence domain where the focus is on three-leg three-phase inverters. To generalize the analysis, two different control strategies used with grid-forming inverters are considered. The equivalent sequence models of these inverters with both strategies are discussed in detail and numerical simulations are used to further clarify the analysis. It is observed that grid-forming inverters with different types of control strategies show a consistent behavior in the positive-sequence circuit during faults for a given voltage drop. Conversely, the negative-sequence model of grid-forming inverters is heavily influenced by the control strategy. The analysis and results are useful to develop reliable protection schemes in inverter-based grids, as understanding the characteristics of electrical elements in the sequence domain is essential for any protective function.},

   abstract = {The impedance model is widely used for analyzing power converters. However, the output impedance is an external representation of a converter system, i.e., it compresses the entire dynamics into a single transfer function with internal details of the interaction between states hidden. As a result, there are no programmatic routines to link each control parameter to the system dynamic modes and to show the interactions among them, which makes the designers rely on their experience and heuristic to interpret the impedance model and its implications. To overcome these obstacles, this article proposes a new modeling tool named as impedance circuit model, visualizing the closed-loop power converter as an impedance circuit with discrete circuit elements rather than an all-in-one impedance transfer function. It can reveal the virtual impedance essence of all control parameters at different impedance locations and/or within different frequency bandwidths, and show their interactions and coupling effects.

Then they verify the suitability of a positive-sequence performance-based model and a detailed electromagnetic transient (EMT) model for utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) plants under different fault conditions. Based on the results, they perform dynamic simulations on a large practical system with both positive-sequence transient stability (TS) and EMT-TS hybrid simulation. This study shows that positive-sequence performance based PV plant model is more suitable for study cases with faults relatively far away from the point of connection. In addition, the results indicate that positive-sequence models and TS simulation approach can produce comparable results with reference to the EMT-TS hybrid simulation with EMT detailed models for normally-cleared single-line-toground faults, but the inadequacy of positive-sequence based model and simulation approach becomes obvious for prolongedtripping of unbalanced faults in the proximity of the PV plants.},

However, most existing methods attempt to generate distributed virtual inertia by grid-following power converters. As compared with conventional grid-feeding power converters, grid-forming power converters, i.e. the ones controlled as ac voltage sources, are more promising owing to their capabilities of voltage and frequency regulation. As such, this paper explores the possibility of inertia emulation by grid-forming power converters. Through the stability analysis, it is revealed that the instability issue is associated with typical virtual inertia control. Further, a lead-lag compensator is introduced to resolve this issue.

   abstract = {Grassland and farmland degradation is considered as one of the worst environmental and economic threats for China. The degradation process negatively affects food and water security, economy, society and climate changes. Photovoltaic water pumping (PVWP) technology for irrigation is an innovative and sustainable solution to curb the grassland degradation. At the same time it can promote the conservation of farmland, especially in remote areas of China. The combination of PVWP technology with water saving irrigation techniques and sustainable management of the groundwater resources can lead to several benefits. These include enhancing grassland productivity, halting wind and rainfall erosion, providing higher incomes and better living conditions for farmers. This doctoral thesis aims to bridge the current knowledge gaps, optimize system implementation and prevent system failures. This work represents thus a step forward to solve the current and future nexus between energy, water and food security in China, using PVWP technology for irrigation. Models for the dynamic simulations of PVWP systems, irrigation water requirements (IWR) and crop response to water have been presented and integrated. Field measurements at a pilot PVWP system in Inner Mongolia have been conducted to analyse the reliability of the models adopted. A revision of the traditional design approaches and a new optimization procedure based on a genetic algorithm (GA) have been proposed to guarantee the match between IWR and water supply, to minimize the system failures and to maximize crop productivity and thus the PVWP system profitability and effectiveness. Several economic analyses have been conducted to establish the most cost effective solution for irrigation and to evaluate the project profitability. The possible benefits generated by the PVWP system implementation have been highlighted, as well as the effects of the most sensitive parameters, such as forage price and incentives. The results show that PVWP system represents the best technical and economic solution to provide water for irrigation in the remote areas compared to other traditional water pumping technologies. The environmental benefits have been also addressed, evaluating the CO2 emissions saving achievable from the PVWP system operation. The assessment of the feasible and optimal areas for implementing PVWP systems in China has been conducted using spatial analysis and an optimization tool for the entire supply chain of forage production. The results show that the potentials of PVWP systems in China are large. Nevertheless, the feasible and optimal locations are extremely sensitive to several environmental and economic parameters such as forage IWR, groundwater depth, and CO2 credits that need to be carefully taken into account in the planning process. Although this doctoral thesis has used China as case study, PVWP technology can be applied for irrigation purposes all over the world both for off- and on-grid applications leading to several economic and environmental benefits.},

   abstract = {The increase in renewable energy penetration into Ontario’s electricity market has altered the overall behaviour of the energy market, with negative electricity prices even starting to appear. Negative prices represent a greater supply than the market demands, mostly appearing at night and during off-peak periods. Energy storage can be deployed in Ontario for peak shaving and energy shifting from off-peak to peak periods to address the above-mentioned issues. This is also the concern of many other system operators across the world. This thesis is mainly focused on developing optimization-based models for scheduling of energy storage units. At first, a real-time optimal scheduling algorithm is developed seeking to maximize the storage revenue by exploiting arbitrage opportunities available due to the inter-temporal variation of electricity prices. The electricity price modulation is proposed as an approach to competitively offer incentive by the utility regulator to storage to fill the gap between current and a stable rate of return. Subsequently, the application of large-scale storage for congestion relief in transmission systems as an ancillary service to the grid is investigated. An algorithm is proposed for the following objectives: (i) to generate revenue primarily by exploiting electricity price arbitrage opportunities and (ii) to optimally prepare the storage to maximize its contribution to transmission congestion relief. In addition, an algorithm is proposed to enable independently operated, locally controlled storage to accept dispatch instructions issued by Independent System Operators (ISOs). Storage in this case is referred to as dispatchable storage. While the operation of locally controlled storage is optimally scheduled at the owner’s end, using the proposed algorithm, storage is fully dispatchable at the ISO’s end. Finally, a model is proposed and analyzed to aggregate storage benefits for a largescale load. The complete model for optimal operation of storage-based electrical loads considering both the capital and operating expenditures of storage is developed. The applications of the proposed algorithms and models are examined using real-world market data adopted from Ontario’s electricity market and actual load information from a large-scale institutional electricity consumer in Ontario.},

Water and energy are fundamental factors for socio-economic development of the communities, especially those located in remote locations.

The method was validated in a pilot system, located in a rural community in the city of Orleans, State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The place has one of the lowest average annual radiation in the country, approximately 4.5 kWh / m².day. Under critical period and natural system conditions, the simulation results are in a very close agreement with 0.98% of the monitored behavior, demonstrating therefore the efficiency of the method. The proposed tool can assist the decision-making process on the design projects and benefit communities where access to water and energy is limited bringing benefits in all spheres: social, environmental and economic.},

   abstract = {Renewable and environmentally friendly green technologies are more preferable and currently show an increasing importance over traditional energy sources such as fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Solar energy is one of the cleanest among renewable resources and has lower maintenance costs compared to other alternatives, e.g. wind, biomass. Prevention of contaminating gases' emissions and low maintenance costs are the benefits of solar energy whereas high investment costs, dependency on weather conditions and hourly changes in day-time are the main disadvantages. Solar radiation incident on a surface varies randomly due to the dynamic characteristics of Earth's atmosphere. This random variability and unpredictability of solar radiation makes difficult the penetration of solar energy implementations and complicate the system design. In order to plan, manage solar energy installations efficiently and to guide system designers, accurate solar radiation forecasting is essential. For this purpose, this study analyzes various time series and fuzzy integrated forecasting methods. Solar radiation forecasting methods are generally classified in three types: physical models that depend on meteorological parameters, statistical methods that depend on past radiation values and new approaches including non-parametric statistical methods and stochastic forecasting methods. Besides the literature review of solar radiation forecasting methods, time series models and Box-Jenkins methodology have been described in details. Fuzzy time series (FTS) models have been developed for linguistic and nonlinear data where the assumption of stationarity is no longer needed. FTS are effective forecasting tools with uncertain data and they are widely used in economics, education, etc. This study is the first successful attempt at implementing FTS on radiation which possesses an irregular and random nature. The aim is to find the methods having higher accuracy of forecasting for solar radiation. Therefore experimental tests have been carried out with test data and the performances of forecasting methods are compared according to statistical forecasting errors. These methods are traditional time series, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models and fuzzy time series models. Additionally, existing fuzzy models have been improved using 8 different hybrid models which combine and develop aspects of the original FTSs. As the radiation contains seasonal pattern, a deseasonalization procedure has been performed in order to reduce errors. The forecasts were produced with deseasonalized data after seasonal index calculations were performed. To calculate seasonal indices, a "ratio to moving averages" technique was used. The experimental tests have been also realized for original and deseasonalized data. The calculations of fuzzy forecasts have been applied easily with codings developed in MATLAB and time series forecasts using statistical softwares. The results have proved that the proposed Hybrid Model-8 shows higher performance compared to other fuzzy models and traditional time series methods. Furthermore, the deseasonalization procedure applied to fuzzy models has been founded more successful considering the decrease in the forecasting error results. After determining the models which have smaller errors especially with solar radiation test data, the real datasets of both radiation and temperature have been obtained from Turkish State Meteorological Service. Then the missing values have been estimated with interpolation and the forecasting models have been applied with real data of 7 provinces of Turkey for a period 25 years which is considered in this study as the lifetime of solar energy systems. These forecasts of solar radiation and similarly of temperature are utilizable in many solar energy applications. Once solar radiation is properly forecasted, many applications are possible in energy systems that transform solar beams into electrical energy. Designing, planning, optimal sizing and decision making, site selection or optimal allocation of energy systems and also meteorological forecasting need solar radiation data. Accurate prediction of radiation improves the efficiency of these applications and prevents unnecessary expenses with the appropriate sizing of the system's components. Photovoltaic (PV) systems are developed as stand-alone, grid-connected or hybrid systems. In stand-alone systems, all the electricity demand is supplied by the PV system. Stand-alone PV water pumping systems effectively use solar energy for irrigation purposes in remote areas. However the random variability and unpredictability of solar energy makes difficult the penetration of PV implementations and complicate the system design. An optimal sizing of these systems proves to be essential. The optimal sizing and techno-economic evaluation of PV water pumping systems is basically dependent to the required hydraulic energy and its relation to monthly average daily solar radiation. In general, optimal sizing methods which commonly considered single objective are carried out with simulations and heuristic methods. In the present study, multi-objective optimization is handled and a mathematical model is defined according to reliability and cost parameters. This study also recommends techno-economic optimization models to determine optimally the capacity of the components of PV water pumping system using a water storage tank or batteries. The proposed models are developed regarding the reliability and cost indicators, which are the deficiency of power supply probability and life-cycle costs, respectively. The technical performance of the system is quantified by the ratio of actual power supplied and total power required for pumping water to meet irrigation requirements. It is obvious that to increase the reliability, i.e. minimize the energy deficit, PV system size must be greater in order to cover water supply requirements, while the costs also increase. Therefore a compromise solution of these two objectives is requisite to guide the system designers and investors. The novelty of this study is that the second proposed optimization model is analytically defined for two-objectives and it is able to find a compromise solution using the weighting method, whereas existing sizing methods are carried out with simulations or heuristics and analytical methods are only focused on single objective function. Although solving in analytical way is harder than computational methods, a better approximation to the optimal is effectively reached. The sizing of a stand-alone PV water pumping system comprises a detailed analysis of crop water requirements and optimal tilt angles. Besides the necessity to long solar radiation and temperature time series, the accurate forecasts of irrigation needs have to be determined. The tilt of PV array is commonly set to an angle equal to the latitude. However the calculation of the optimal tilt angle for yearly, seasonally and monthly frequencies, and install the system accordingly results in higher system efficiency. It is, therefore, suggested to change regularly the tilt angle in order to maximize solar energy output. The proposed optimal sizing models incorporate all these improvements and can accomplish a comprehensive optimization of PV water pumping systems. The tilt angles are changed yearly and seasonally in different scenarios. Also the storage units are differed as water tank and batteries in order to compare the performances. A case study is conducted considering the irrigation of citrus trees yard located in Antalya, Turkey. The proposed analytical model (Model-2) is compared with the computational model (Model-1) and it is shown that sizing results are similar for an analysis of 25 years. Thus the accuracy of the results of Model-2 is pointed out. A performance analysis is carried out using several performance parameters and the impact of chosen solar radiation forecasting methods to the optimal sizing results is investigated.},

A simulation model, which combines the dynamics of photovoltaic water pumping system, groundwater level, water supply, crop water demand and crop yield, is employed during the optimization. To prove the effectiveness of the new optimization approach, it has been applied to an existing photovoltaic water pumping system. Results show that the optimal configuration can guarantee continuous operations and lead to a substantial reduction of photovoltaic array size and consequently of the investment capital cost and the payback period. Sensitivity studies have been conducted to investigate the impacts of the prices of photovoltaic modules and forage on the optimization. Results show that the water resource is a determinant factor.},

This paper discusses issues in optimizing the use of such stations and presents a procedure to evaluate different PV schemes considering the stochastic natures of the insolation and the load. The reliability measures in terms of loss of load hours (LOLH), the energy loss and the total cost have been used as the indices for evaluation of different schemes. The insolation and the load demand are modeled as stochastic variables using historical data and experimentation respectively. The operation of various stand-alone schemes are simulated for a specific load. Actual commercially available panel and battery sizes with actual costs have been used in the various configurations studied. The long run expected values of the performance indices for various configurations of the solar station have been measured. Comparative analysis of the results show that higher cost not necessarily translates into better performance. The panel size and the battery size have different impacts on the indices of performance, and a proper balance between the two is necessary to optimize the operation of a stand-alone PV scheme. © 1997 IEEE.},

A microgrid concept is needed in order to integrate the renewable sources in the electrical grid. It comprises low voltage (LV) system with distributed energy resources (DERs) together with storage devices and flexible loads. The integration of RES into a microgrid can cause challenges and impacts on microgrid operation. Thus, in this thesis, an optimal sizing and security, reliability and economic efficiency operation strategies of a microgrid including photovoltaic productions (PV), battery energy storage systems (BESS) and/or diesels is proposed. Firstly, the iterative optimization technique is used to find the optimal sizing of a microgrid. Secondly, the voltage and frequency control strategies for an island microgrid by using droop control methods are studied. Furthermore, we propose intelligent voltage and frequency control strategies by using fuzzy logic. By this way, the frequency is expressed not only as the function of active power but also the state of charge of BESS and the operation states of microgrid. And finally, a method to optimize the energy management in operation of a microgrid is proposed in this thesis. Dynamic programming is used to find the minimum the cost of fuel considering the emissions by scheduling of distributed energy resources (DERs) in an island microgrid as well as to minimize the cash flows and the exchanged power with the main grid in a grid-connected mode. The simulation results obtained show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed solutions.},

The major goal of this thesis is to build a library of various Microgrid components. First of all, the thesis is going to present a detailed description of Microgrid models with moderate complexity. Next, it will present the modeling of loads, utility grid and transmission lines. Then, the paper will discuss the distributed generation models that have been developed in Matlab/Simulink including Diesel Engine, Fuel Cell, Micro Gas Turbine, Wind Turbine, Photovoltaic Cell, along with the detailed modeling of short-term storage (Battery, Pumped Hydro Storage, Flywheel, and Supercapacitor). In addition to steady-state study, the thesis will also discuss the hybrid sample systems that are built to investigate their transient responses. To enhance the simulation performance, some improvements on modeling and simulation will be introduced as well. To accommodate the high demand of renewable energy and the environment policy, the planning and operation the of Micro-source generators has been studied using HOMER. Simulation results show a case study of an optimal microgrid configuration on Ontario area in Canada. Sensitivity variables are specified to examine the effect of uncertainties, especially in a long-term planning. Also, demand side management plays an important role in the operation of Microgrid. Based on raw data, case studies are carried out to investigate and validate the demand response methods. Finally, the philosophy for Microgrid protection, especially Time-delay overcurrent protection, will be briefly introduced in both gird-connected and islanding modes.},

Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) can be installed in such circumstances to supply the demand and support the reserve requirements of the isolated microgrid. However, due to the high installation costs of BESS, there is a need for proper mechanisms to select such systems and size them optimally. Furthermore, since BESS are often installed to serve multiple applications, these should be properly modeled to coordinate their different functionalities. In this thesis, a multi-year operational planning model is developed to determine the BESS optimal power rating and energy capacity along with the year of installation taking into account its coordinated operation. The model includes unit commitment formulation with renewable energy and BESS operational constraints. The optimal planning decisions are obtained for different BESS technologies under several scenarios of ownerships. The uncertain patterns of solar and wind resources and system demand are considered and several microgrid operational scenarios are created. A stochastic optimization model is developed to determine the optimal BESS size and installation year including the different states of the uncertain microgrid variables. The stochastic optimization model is solved using a decomposition based two-stage iterative approach to cope with the large computational burden of such problems.},

   abstract = {A microgrid (MG) is a local entity that consists of distributed energy resources (DERs) to achieve local power reliability and sustainable energy utilization. The MG concept or renewable energy technologies integrated with energy storage systems (ESS) have gained increasing interest and popularity because it can store energy at off-peak hours and supply energy at peak hours. However, existing ESS technology faces challenges in storing energy due to various issues, such as charging/discharging, safety, reliability, size, cost, life cycle, and overall management. Thus, an advanced ESS is required with regard to capacity, protection, control interface, energy management, and characteristics to enhance the performance of ESS in MG applications. This paper comprehensively reviews the types of ESS technologies, ESS structures along with their configurations, classifications, features, energy conversion, and evaluation process. Moreover, details on the advantages and disadvantages of ESS in MG applications have been analyzed based on the process of energy formations, material selection, power transfer mechanism, capacity, efficiency, and cycle period. Existing reviews critically demonstrate the current technologies for ESS in MG applications. However, the optimum management of ESSs for efficient MG operation remains a challenge in modern power system networks. This review also highlights the key factors, issues, and challenges with possible recommendations for the further development of ESS in future MG applications. All the highlighted insights of this review significantly contribute to the increasing effort toward the development of a cost-effective and efficient ESS model with a prolonged life cycle for sustainable MG implementation.},

   abstract = {Microgrids are local energy providers which reduce energy expense and gas emissions by utilising distributed energy resources (DERs) and are considered to be promising alternatives to existing centralised systems. However, currently, problems exist concerning their design and utilisation. This thesis investigates the optimal design and planning of microgrids using mathematical programming methods. First, a fair economic settlement scheme is considered for the participants of a microgrid. A mathematical programming formulation is proposed involving the fair electricity transfer price and unit capacity selection based on the Game-theory Nash bargaining approach. The problem is first formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model, and is then reformulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. Second, an MILP model is formulated for the optimal scheduling of energy consumption of smart homes. DER operation and electricity consumption tasks are scheduled based on real-time electricity pricing, electricity task time windows and forecasted renewable energy output. A peak charge scheme is also adopted to reduce the peak demand from the grid. Next, an MILP model is proposed to optimise the respective costs among multiple customers in a smart building. It is based on the minimisation/maximisation optimisation approach for the lexicographic minimax/maximin method, which guarantees a Pareto-optimal solution. Consequently each customer will pay a fair energy cost based on their respective energy consumption. Finally, optimum electric vehicle (EV) battery operation scheduling and its related degradation are addressed within smart homes. EV batteries can be used as electricity storage for domestic appliances and provide vehicle to grid (V2G) services. However, they increase the battery degradation and decrease the battery performance. Therefore the objective is to minimise the total electricity cost and degradation cost while maintaining the demand under the agreed threshold by scheduling the operation of EV batteries.},

   abstract = {With the increase in the level of global warming, renewable energy based distributed generators (DGs) will increasingly play a dominant role in electricity production. Distributed generation based on solar energy (photovoltaic and solar thermal), wind, biomass, mini-hydro along with use of fuel cells and micro turbines will gain considerable momentum in the near future. A microgrid consists of clusters of load and distributed generators that operate as a single controllable system. The interconnection of the DG to the utility/grid through power electronic converters has raised concern about safe operation and protection of the equipments. Many innovative control techniques have been used for enhancing the stability of microgrid as for proper load sharing. The most common method is the use of droop characteristics for decentralized load sharing. Parallel converters have been controlled to deliver desired real power (and reactive power) to the system. Local signals are used as feedback to control converters, since in a real system, the distance between the converters may make the inter-communication impractical. The real and reactive power sharing can be achieved by controlling two independent quantities, frequency and fundamental voltage magnitude. In this thesis, an angle droop controller is proposed to share power amongst converter interfaced DGs in a microgrid. As the angle of the output voltage can be changed instantaneously in a voltage source converter (VSC), controlling the angle to control the real power is always beneficial for quick attainment of steady state. Thus in converter based DGs, load sharing can be performed by drooping the converter output voltage magnitude and its angle instead of frequency. The angle control results in much lesser frequency variation compared to that with frequency droop. An enhanced frequency droop controller is proposed for better dynamic response and smooth transition between grid connected and islanded modes of operation. A modular controller structure with modified control loop is proposed for better load sharing between the parallel connected converters in a distributed generation system. Moreover, a method for smooth transition between grid connected and islanded modes is proposed. Power quality enhanced operation of a microgrid in presence of unbalanced and non-linear loads is also addressed in which the DGs act as compensators. The compensator can perform load balancing, harmonic compensation and reactive power control while supplying real power to the grid A frequency and voltage isolation technique between microgrid and utility is proposed by using a back-to-back converter. As utility and microgrid are totally isolated, the voltage or frequency fluctuations in the utility side do not affect the microgrid loads and vice versa. Another advantage of this scheme is that a bidirectional regulated power flow can be achieved by the back-to-back converter structure. For accurate load sharing, the droop gains have to be high, which has the potential of making the system unstable. Therefore the choice of droop gains is often a tradeoff between power sharing and stability. To improve this situation, a supplementary droop controller is proposed. A small signal model of the system is developed, based on which the parameters of the supplementary controller are designed. Two methods are proposed for load sharing in an autonomous microgrid in rural network with high R/X ratio lines. The first method proposes power sharing without any communication between the DGs. The feedback quantities and the gain matrixes are transformed with a transformation matrix based on the line R/X ratio. The second method involves minimal communication among the DGs. The converter output voltage angle reference is modified based on the active and reactive power flow in the line connected at point of common coupling (PCC). It is shown that a more economical and proper power sharing solution is possible with the web based communication of the power flow quantities. All the proposed methods are verified through PSCAD simulations. The converters are modeled with IGBT switches and anti parallel diodes with associated snubber circuits. All the rotating machines are modeled in detail including their dynamics.},

Weather forecasts are thus necessary to establish optimal plans according to the operational objectives and priorities of each microgid.

Despite this, weather information plays a secondary role in most of microgrid studies.

Data sources, methodologies, uncertainty approaches and results from a selection of papers with complete information about the forecast context are analysed in detail.

So the optimal placing of the components assigns to the required parts of hybrid microgrid. Also, this study reviews new ways of energy practice of hybrid sources. It presents the physical modelling of the renewable energy resources with numerous methodologies and principles of the optimization for the hybrid networks. Additionally, the hybrid sources are gaining popular and fame in the environmental crises and current scenario of energies. Based on this study, it has introduced a global survey on the present condition of optimization techniques especially that related to the isolated microgrid in the presented literature. The current trend of optimization for hybrid renewable sources demonstrations that artificial intelligence provides worthy optimization for the microgrid operations without an extensive long-term weather data.},

Summer houses are widespread in this area, and it is impossible for these buildings to benefit from grid connection. Optimal sizing of hybrid PV-Diesel-Battery systems prove to be very economical as an energy source for these houses. The optimization demonstrated that the lowest investment cost was 12,400 Turkish liras, and renewable energy part of the proposed system was calculated as 79%. In this respect, the system was optimally sized with a PV of 3 kW, a diesel generator of 1 kW, a converter of 2 kW and 6 units of battery. PV panels and diesel generator generate 4248 and 773 kW h/year, respectively, which amounts to 5021 kW h/year. This is a Hybrid PV-Diesel-Battery system. It consists of renewable (PV System) and non-renewable (Diesel Generator) energy sources. Therefore, this paper focuses on optimal sizing of the proposed system. Total annual energy demand is 2353.8 kW h/year, and the remaining amount is stored in the batteries. Total renewable production divided by load, total renewable production divided by generation, and renewable energy part of the proposed system are 116.38%, 84.6%, and %79, respectively. In addition to its cost effective energy supply, the system is also environment-friendly. Hybrid PV-Diesel-Battery system prevented 44.024 tCO2, 123.39 kg of CO, 13.471 kg of UHCs, 9.16 kg of PM, 90.52 kg of SO2 and 1100.33 kg of NOx.

The microgrid contains different electrical loads such as industrial livestock, agricultural products packaging factory, drip irrigation system, lighting and other small loads. The microgrid is connected to the upstream network at the grid supply point (GSP) and supplies loads with power from the upstream network and a wind power unit located in the farm. The proposed framework optimizes day-ahead (DA) scheduling of power exchange with the upstream network, pumped-storage unit and irrigation system based on forecasted wind power, microgrid load demand and water needed for irrigation in a market environment. The two-point estimate method (TPEM) is implemented to model the uncertainties associated with wind power and wholesale market prices.

In rural and remote areas, the integrated PV technology with remote micro-grid offers a potential solution for agriculture and small businesses to access to clean, reliable and efficient energy source. As the cost of solar PV modules continues to show a downward tendency, the distributed PV systems with remote micro-grid are capable to meet growing energy demand with affordable price. Meanwhile, a series of policies and actions have been enacted in China since 2013, to motivate the distributed-generation PV development as equal as large-scale PV development. However, compared to coal-fired power plants or large-scale PV systems, a barrier exists in securing financing of distributed PV systems, which has high up-front costs and the risk of commercializing renewable energy initiatives. Under current market incentives and barriers, this paper studies the existing financing methods in distributed PV systems with remote distributed micro-grids. In comparison with other financing sources, a case study approach is employed with distributed PV water pumping system in China to introduce crowd-funding as a new source of financing in distributed PV systems. Through the SWOT analysis, this paper identifies a capacity for new financial approach of crowd-funding with PVWP deployment. The scenario is modelled for different stakeholders and organization forms that target social network interactions in crowd-funding, and the results provide insights for incentives and policy.},

The integration of such distributed energy sources into utility grid paves the way for microgrids. The microgrid concept is introduced to have a self-sustained system consisting of distributed energy resources that can operate in an islanded mode during grid failures. In microgrid, an energy management system is essential for optimal use of these distributed energy resources in intelligent, secure, reliable, and coordinated ways. Therefore, this review paper presents a comparative and critical analysis on decision making strategies and their solution methods for microgrid energy management systems. To manage the volatility and intermittency of renewable energy resources and load demand, various uncertainty quantification methods are summarized. A comparative analysis on communication technologies is also discussed for cost-effective implementation of microgrid energy management systems.

With the high penetration of distributed generators, it is challenging to provide a reliable, consistent power supply for local customers, because of the time-varying weather conditions and intermittent energy outputs in nature. Likewise, the electricity consumption changes due to the season effect and human behaviour in response to the changes in electricity tariff. Therefore, studies on accurate forecasting power generation and load demand are worthwhile in order to solve unit commitment and schedule the operation of energy storage devices. The paper firstly gives a brief introduction about microgrid and reviews forecasting algorithms for power supply side and load demand. Then, the mainstream energy management approaches applied to the microgrid, including centralized control, decentralized control and distributed control schemes are presented. A number of the optimal energy management algorithms are highlighted for centralized controllers based on short-term forecasting information and a generalized centralized control scheme is thus summarized. Consensus protocol is discussed in this paper to solve the cooperative problem under the multi-agent system-based distributed energy system. Finally, the future of energy forecasting approaches and energy management strategies are discussed.},

   abstract = {Virtual Synchronous Machine also called VISMA [1] is a control algorithm to make an inverter operated as a conventional electromechanical synchronous machine. It is a promising solution to overcome the problems of the grid stability and quality, which have been exacerbated by increasing integration of distributed generation units into the grid. Compared to the conventional power plants, in which the synchronous machine dominate, the distributed generation units have either significantly smaller or no rotating mass and damping effect. These weaknesses can be compensated by using the VISMA concept and thus the power system quality will be improved. Furthermore, the penetration level of the DG sources won't be restricted any more. Up to now the VISMA was implemented by using a voltage-to-current model on a hysteresis controlled inverter [1][2][3]. This method will be called VISMA-Method 1 here. Since the most products of inverters in the market are PWM controlled, the VISMA-Method 1 cannot be easily applied on these inverters. Therefore, a new method is developed to implement the VISMA by using a current-to-voltage model on the currently widely applied PWM controlled inverter. This new method is called VISMA-Method 2 in this paper and will be compared with the VISMA-Method 1 by simulation results.},

RES units, notably inverter-connected wind turbines and photovoltaics (PV) that as such do not provide rotational inertia, are effectively displacing conventional generators and their rotating machinery. The traditional assumption that grid inertia is sufficiently high with only small variations over time is thus not valid for power systems with high RES shares. This has implications for frequency dynamics and power system stability and operation. Frequency dynamics are faster in power systems with low rotational inertia, making frequency control and power system operation more challenging.

Moreover, economic and environmental pressure has led to an increasing renewable power penetration, particularly in wind generation and solar photovoltaics (PV). Simultaneously, significant technological progress has been made in terms of control capability of grid assets [generators, controllable loads such as electric vehicles (EVs), and energy storage systems], mostly exploiting the capabilities of power ?electronics. In this context, several advanced control solutions can be implemented, supporting and improving the robustness of the operation in terms of fast frequency and voltage control responses. In this article, the Portuguese islands are taken as a case study. Within the Madeira archipelago (Porto Santo and Madeira islands), two approaches were envisioned. For Porto Santo Island, the main goal is the sizing of a flywheel energy storage system (FESS) to avoid frequency stability problems. For Madeira Island, the objective relies on the exploitation of hydro resources through the quantification of the technical benefits resulting from variable speed hydro pumping stations that are able to provide primary frequency regulation services in the pump operation mode. In addition, this article also addresses the benefits of introducing EVs in Flores Island in the Azores Archipelago. Finally, to support the development of innovative technological solutions for this type of power system, a laboratory setup based on scaled test systems was also set up and is described. A set of applications was specifically developed for such autonomous power systems.

Due to the increased use of power electronics-both to connect Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and as drives for electric motors-inertia levels are generally reduced and become time dependent. The same power electronic technologies can also be used to actively provide inertia to the power system, raising the question what effect changes in inertia has on power system stability, and how to best place devices providing virtual inertia. We propose an optimization program that answers these question, and analytically derive the sensitivities of transient frequency overshoot and damping ratio to inertia and damping. An example shows how damping ratio can be improved while transient frequency limits are respected.},

The paper also proposes the idea of adjusting pitch compensation and maximum active power order to the converter in order to improve inertial response during the transient with response to drop in grid frequency. Results obtained on a large realistic power system indicate that the frequency nadir following a large power impact in the form of generators dropping out is effectively improved with the proposed control strategy. The proposed control is also validated against the sudden wind speed change in the form of wind gust downs and wind ramp downs occurring in conjunction with the generators dropping out. A beneficial impact in terms of damping power system oscillations is also observed, which is validated by eigenvalue analysis. The affected mode is then excited with a large disturbance in time domain. The damping improvement observed in time domain and subsequent Prony analysis support the result obtained from eigenvalue analysis. © 2010 IEEE.},

When in future small nonsynchronous generation units replace a significant part of the synchronous power generation capacity, the total rotational inertia of the synchronous generators is decreased significantly. This causes large frequency variations that can end up in an unstable grid. A way to stabilize the grid frequency is to add virtual rotational inertia to the distributed generators. A virtual inertia can be attained for any generator by adding a short-term energy storage to it, combined with a suitable control mechanism for its power electronics converter. In this way a generator can behave like a "Virtual Synchronous Generator" (VSG) during short time intervals, and contribute to stabilization of the grid frequency. © 2008 IEEE.},

In order to address the inertia issue, this paper proposes a concept for all the grid-connected power converters to realize distributed virtual inertia. This can be achieved through regulating the dc-link voltages of power converters so that their dc-link capacitors are aggregated into an extremely large capacitor for frequency support. Moreover, the decisive factors of virtual inertia are identified and analyzed. Simulation and experiment results indicate that more than 10% frequency deviation reduction and 50% improvement of rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) can be expected with the proposed concept.},

It has been shown that from the technical as well as from an economic and environmental point of view the SVC PLUS Frequency Stabilizer and battery storage can provide the needed synthetic inertia in order to mitigate large frequency deviations. Furthermore, on comparing the SVC PLUS Frequency Stabilizer and battery storages it has been shown that for short time applications in range of several seconds (typical duration before the primary response starts) the SVC PLUS Frequency Stabilizer has significant economical and footprint advantages over battery solutions.

   abstract = {Inertia provision for frequency control is among the ancillary services that different national grid codes will likely require to be provided by future wind turbines. The aim of this paper is analysing how the inertia response support from a variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) to the primary frequency control of a power system can be enhanced. Unlike fixed speed wind turbines, VSWTs do not inherently contribute to system inertia, as they are decoupled from the power system through electronic converters. Emphasis in this paper is on how to emulate VSWTs inertia using control of the power electronic converter and on its impact on the primary frequency response of a power system. An additional control for the power electronics is implemented to give VSWTs a virtual inertia, referring to the kinetic energy stored in the rotating masses, which can be released initially to support the system's inertia. A simple Matlab/Simulink model and control of a VSWT and of a generic power system are developed to analyse the primary frequency response following different generation losses in a system comprising VSWTs provided with virtual inertia. The possibility of substituting a 50% share of conventional power with wind is also assessed and investigated. The intrinsic problems related to the implementation of virtual inertia are illustrated, addressing their origin in the action of pitch and power control. A solution is proposed, which aims at obtaining the same response as for the system with only conventional generation. The range of wind speeds near the power limitation zone seems to be the most critical from a primary response point of view. The theoretical reasons behind this are elucidated in the paper.

Without modifications of system hardware, power system inertia can be emulated by the energy stored in the dc-link capacitors of grid-connected power converters. By regulating the dc-link voltages in proportional to the grid frequency, the dc-link capacitors are aggregated into an extremely large equivalent capacitor serving as an energy buffer for frequency support. Furthermore, the limitation of virtual inertia, together with its design parameters, is identified. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed concept is validated through simulation and experimental results, which indicate that 12.5% and 50% improvements of the frequency nadir and rate of change of frequency can be achieved.},

Both the challenges as the solutions from an operator point of view to control a system with low inertia are discussed. Also a new definition of inertia is proposed to incorporate the different forms of inertia which are each described in more detail.

   abstract = {The increasing penetration of variable speed wind turbines in the electricity grid will result in a reduction of the number of connected conventional power plants. This will lead to a reduction of inertia in the grid, as the rotational speed of a variable speed turbine and the grid are decoupled by a power electronic converter. A lower system inertia will result in larger and faster frequency deviations after occurrence of abrupt variations in generation and load. It is possible to implement an additional control loop in the power electronic converter of the turbine, which connects the turbine inertia directly to the grid. It is even possible, by control, to make a 'virtual inertia' that is larger than the real inertia. During a frequency drop additional power can be released to the grid with this control. This behaviour will be called inertial response. The additional power is obtained from the kinetic energy that is stored in the rotating mass of the turbine. In this contribution two different control strategies are investigated and compared with each other. A type of control that is equal to the primary frequency control of large power plants shows the best results, both with respect to the power that is needed to limit the frequency drop and with respect to electrical and mechanical stress of the turbine. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Many control algorithms and circuits for three-phase pulse width modulation active rectifiers have been proposed in the past decades. In most of the research, it is often assumed that the input voltages are balanced or contain only fundamental frequency components. In this paper, a selective harmonic compensation method is proposed based on an improved multiple reference frame algorithm, which decouples signals of different frequencies before reference frame transformation. This technique eliminates interactions between the fundamental-frequency positive-sequence components and harmonic and/or negative-sequence components in the input currents, so that fast and accurate regulation of harmonic and unbalanced currents can be achieved. A decoupled phase-locked loop algorithm is used for proper synchronization with the utility voltage, which also benefits from the multiple reference frame technique. The proposed control method leads to considerable reduction in low-order harmonic contents in the rectifier input current and achieves almost zero steady-state error through feedback loops. Extensive experimental tests based on a fixed-point digital signal processor controlled 2 kW prototype are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ideas. © 2008 IEEE.},

However, it suffers from estimation error when there exist input disturbances, such as initial values and communication delays.

A voltage controller and a frequency controller are designed separately to realize the restoration of voltage/frequency and also accurate reactive/active power allocation. Moreover, a detailed small-signal model with PI consensus algorithm is established to show the impact of the proposed control strategy on the system stability. Compared with the conventional distributed control, the proposed control scheme is simpler with higher control accuracy under input disturbances.

   abstract = {Wide-area data and algorithms in large power systems are creating new opportunities for implementation of measurement-based dynamic load modeling techniques. These techniques improve the accuracy of dynamic load models, which are an integral part of transient stability analysis. Measurement-based load modeling techniques commonly assume response error is correlated to system or model accuracy. Response error is the difference between simulation output and phasor measurement units (PMUs) samples. This paper investigates similarity measures, output types, simulation time spans, and disturbance types used to generate response error and the correlation of the response error to system accuracy. This paper aims to address two hypotheses: 1) Can response error indicate if a dynamic load model being used at a bus is sufficiently accurate, and 2) Can response error determine the total system accuracy. The results of the study show only specific combinations of metrics yield statistically significant correlations, and there is a lack of pattern of combinations of metrics that deliver significant correlations. Less than 20% of all simulated tests in this study resulted in statistically significant correlations. These outcomes highlight concerns with common measurement-based load modeling techniques, raising awareness to the importance of careful selection and validation of similarity measures and response output metrics. Naive or untested selection of metrics can deliver inaccurate and misleading results.},

Nonsinusoidal rotor voltages are decomposed into harmonic components and their corresponding sequences are identified. Induced harmonics in stator are analyzed and computed, from which the torques produced by these interactions between stator and rotor harmonic components can be found. During unbalanced stator conditions, symmetric component theory is applied to the stator voltage to get positive-, negative-, and Zero-sequence components of stator and rotor currents. The steady-state negative-sequence equivalent circuit for a DFIG is derived based on the reference frame theory. Harmonic currents in the rotor are computed based on the sequence circuits. In both scenarios, the harmonic components of the electromagnetic torque are calculated from the interactions of the harmonic components of the stator and rotor currents. Three case studies are considered, namely: 1) nonsinusoidal rotor injection; 2) an isolated unbalanced stator load scenario; and 3) unbalanced grid-connected operation. The analysis is verified with results from numerical simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. For illustration, the second case is verified using experiments.

   abstract = {Load harmonic currents and load unbalances reduce power quality (PQ) supplied by electrical networks. Shunt active power filters (SAPFs) are a well-known solution that can be employed to enhance electrical PQ by injecting a compensation current at the point of common coupling (PCC) of the SAPF, the load, and the electrical grid. Hence, SAPF controllers must determine the instantaneous values of the compensation reference current, including nondesirable components of the load current. A family of SAPF controllers, which evaluates the compensation reference current using synchronous rotating frames (SRFs), employs a structure based on Park transformations: direct transform, lowpass filtering (LPF), and inverse transform. The cutoff frequency and the filter order of the LPF stage must be designed properly in order to obtain an accurate reference current and a fast dynamic response of these SAPF controllers. This paper proposes a recursive implementation of the direct Park transformation that avoids the filtering stage and allows accurate SRF controllers to be designed. Moreover, the proposed implementation is not dependent on PCC conditions. The proposed implementation is evaluated using a three-phase, three-wire SAPF and compared with LPF-based controllers by simulation and experiment. © 2009 IEEE.},

   abstract = {In this paper, a method based on the multiple synchronous reference frame analysis is recommended and implemented to detect time-varying harmonics and interharmonics of rapidly fluctuating asymmetrical industrial loads. The experimental work has been carried out on a typical three-phase alternating current arc furnace installation. In the recommended method, the reference frame is rotated in both directions at speeds corresponding to the positive and negative sequences of all harmonics and all interharmonics 5 Hz apart. To extract the direct current components of the transformed d-q quantities, a low-pass filter is employed. In order to keep the delay of the filter at zero frequency less than a few ms, Kalman estimation technique has been used. Back transformation is then applied for each harmonic and interharmonic component to obtain their positive-and negative-sequences of the associated harmonic and interharmonic in the actual line current waveforms. Parallel computing technique has been applied for the real-time detection of both the phase and the amplitude of all harmonics and interharmonics. This is achieved on NVDIA Jetson TX1 graphics processing unit framework for a sample industrial plant. The developed system is shown to be useful for fast and accurate generation of reference signals for the controllers of the advanced technology power conditioning systems which successfully compensates interharmonics, harmonics, and flicker of the rapidly fluctuating nonlinear industrial loads.},

The aim of developing the MSRF analysis framework is twofold; deep understanding of the EAF characteristics, and fast and accurate generation of reference signals to the controllers of the advanced technology compensation systems such as active power filters (APFs), synchronous static compensators (STATCOMs), and energy storage systems (ESS), which may successfully compensate interharmonics, harmonics, and flicker. Online characterization of interharmonics and harmonics by MSRF analysis utilizes continuously measured line currents and line voltages on the medium-voltage side of the EAF transformer at a sampling rate of 25.6-kHz per data channel. It has been shown by offline computations that compensation of the sequence components of interharmonics and harmonics of the EAF currents obtained by the proposed framework, reduces the short-term flicker values at the point of common coupling by up to 10-fold. The proposed MSRF analysis framework has been successfully verified by comparing the frequency spectrums of the EAF currents with Fourier analysis results based on one-cycle sliding windows of 10-cycle duration.},

   abstract = {The fact that, as a matter of necessity, power system steam turbines are in all cases equipped with control systems which include provision to close steam inlet valves rapidly on sudden loss of load as a way to suitably limit speed increase, implies that these systems are basically not difficult to modify so as to allow employment of fast valving as a way to maintain system stability despite the occurrence of a line fault or some other system stability endangering event. Advantageous use of fast valving as a way to improve system stability requires provision for fastest feasible initiation of intercepting valve closure followed by a promptly initiated and initially rapid process of reopening, and preferably also provision within steam sources to allow effecting sustained partial closure of control valves without causing the opening of high pressure safety valves. To gain speed and selectivity initiation of valving needs to be made responsive to fault relaying systems and by this means responsive also the location and type of fault, and can also advantageously take into account prefault conditions. Attention is directed to the fact that design aspects of turbine overspeed protection systems can influence the occurrence and extent of inter-area break-up that sometimes takes place when an area of a system or interconnection experiences a sudden net loss of export load as a result of the opening of area tie lines.

In Ref. [l] it was also suggested that inclusion of FV arid AVR actions contributes to broaden the DEEAC application domains from planning to operation planning and to real-time operation. To make the DEEAC comply with such actions, a research was initiated one year ago on the French power system. The main objective was to first explore whether DEEAC is indeed able to accouiit for these effects, assuming their variation witli time to be known. To this purpose, FV and AVR curves of the French system niacliines were plotted via the tinie-domain EUROSTAG program [4,5], then aggregated and taken into account to modify the parameters of the "basic" DEEAC [I]. The primary objective of this first phase of the research was to explore feasibility aspects, i.e. whether it was indeed feasible to embed FV and AVR within tlie "basic" DEEAC while preserving accuracy and computing speed. A second phase should subsequently be carried out, in older to approximate the time varying characteristics (P,,,, E') exploited by DEEAC, in a way compatible with this fast method. This paper reports on the results of the first phase of the research. EUROSTAG is used here as an intermediary tool to provide the appropriate FV and AVR curves and also as the benchmark for assessing the accuracy of the rcsultiiig "augmented" DEEAC. 2 Detailed models for DEEAC 1 Introduction In a companion paper [I] it was shown that the DEEAC niccts well the requirernents of planning studies of complex power systems as the French system : it does not necd any preliini-nary study, and thanks to its accuracy and computing performances it can treat a inuch larger number of cases tlian tiine-Paper APT 340b-19-07 accepted for presentation at the IEEEiNTUA Athens Power 'Tech Confeience: "Planning, Operation and Conti ol of 'I'uday's Electric Powci Systems", Athens, Gieece, Sept 5-8, 1993. To infer possible ways of modelling FV and AVR actions compatible with the DEEAC, let us consider again its fundamentals , stated in Ref.[I]. Basically, the principle of EEAC amounts to assessing stability (margins and critical clearing times (CCTs)) on the b-tsis of the OMIB dynamics, derived fiorn the multirna-chine system tlirougli appropriate reduction. This principle holds encc is that the dynamic OMIB is obtained stepwise, by allowing the dynamic system parameters to be updated during the tran-sients; the choice of the step size is dictated by accuracy. In Ref. [l], the DEEAC has been illustrated in the oversimplified case of two steps for each of tlie during-and post-fault phases. The other extreme stepwise decomposition may be provided by a SBS numerical program using the same standard simplified system model as DEEAC, and run for the multimachine system, valid for the static, a s well as for the dynamic EEAC.},

   abstract = {As steam turbine generator units increase in rating, their inertia constants tend to decrease and their reactance constants to increase, thus aggravating the power system transient stability problem. There is also a tendency for the complete unit to take longer to restart and reload when unscheduled discon-nection from the system takes place. Counter measures are needed and may be available within the power plant. A study of these measures was made by the authors acting as a Working Group of NewEngland's NEPLAN Planning Committee's System Design Task Force. The paper presents the Working Group's findings as widely supported by the major utilities in New Eng-land. INTRODUCTION a. Physical Limitations of Fault Clearing Equipment In recent years, with the interconnection of many large power systems, the trend has been toward higher voltage transmission lines and larger generating units. These interconnected power systems have proven to be both reliable and economical. Several problems have been encountered, however, from this method of operation, leading to increased diffi-cu lty in maintaining system stability. The large generating plants, in most cases, are located a considerable distance from load centers formanyeconomic and political reasons. The power must then be transmitted to the load centers via high voltage transmission lines and today, power companies are finding it increasingly diffi-cu It to obtain right-of-ways for these overhead high voltage lines. Many lines are delayed years after planned in-service date and some plans are even abandoned. These problems can have an adverse effect on the stability of the system. Another factor affecting stabi lity is the relatively low inertia of new generating units. During system short circuits , they tend to speed up faster than most older and smaller units and, therefore, are less stable. The accelerating power of a turbine-generator unit is equated to the mechanical power input tothe turbine minusthe electrical power output of the generator. In the past, in order to prevent a unit from accelerating beyond the point of no return, means were used of increasing the electrical power output of the unit during fault conditions. This was done either by decreasing the fau It clearing time (relaying time plus breaker operation time) or increasing the number of transmission lines out of a station, or both. The stage has now been reached where fault clearing times have been decreased as far as modern technology will permit-four cycles normal clearing time and eight to eleven and one-half cycles delayed clearing time for 345 kV transmission lines. In some cases, however, these virtually irreducible clearing times are insufficient to prevent the instability of a unit. In light of this problem, the System Design Task Force of the New Eng land Planning Committee established the Stabi 1-ity Equipment Working Group. The objective of this group was to determine availability, feasibility, and applicability of new methods for maintaining and/or improving system stability. The methods taken under consideration were braking resistors, short-circuit current limiting devices, turbine fast valving and full load rejection systems. b. Methods for Maintaining Stability 1. Braking Resistors The stability of power stations remotely located from the major load centers is jeopardized by transmission line faults. When a fault occurs on the system, the voltage falls instantaneously preventing power from being transmitted beyond this point. When no power can be transmitted and there isno local load to absorb power, itall goes into accelerating the machines. Braking resistors act as a substitute for the system load. During a fault, the resistors are applied to the terminals of the generator through circuit breakers by means of an elaborate control scheme. The control scheme determines how much resistance must be applied, the phase-to-phase pro-portionment of this resistance, and the duration of application. The braking resistors remain on for a matter of cycles both during fault clearing and after system voltage is restored. The control scheme must also be able to derive a quantity which distinguishes between various types of faults, and is also dependent on their location.

This paper presents an analysis of the mechanical and electrical performance characteristics of the Rockport unit during TFTV. A comparison of the test measurements with digital simulation results is also provided to validate the simulation tools and models commonly used in system dynamics studies.},

   abstract = {One of the most effective method to preserve generator stability following close-in three-phase faults is the so called "fast-valving" of the turbine. This action may cause one or more pole slippings of the generator before re- synchronizing. The paper is aimed to investigate, by me:Tns of computer simulations of both the power system and its protective devices, the possible protection maloperations. The analysis of the results allows to put into evidence what relays are likely to operate during pole-slipping, and what kind of counter-measures have to be studied to avoid unwished trippings.},

@report{Edwards1986,
   abstract = {Fast valving or early valve actuation is a means to rapidly reduce mechanical power on turbine-generators to prevent excessive acceleration when a significant power-load im¬ balance is sensed. There are a number of methods and considerations in applying fast valving. The "short note" reports discuss considerations such as:. Momentary (temporary) fast valving versus sustained fast valving.. Which valves (control, intercept, or both) to close, and then reopen or reposition.. Method of initiating fast valving.. Effect on boiler or steam generator safety/relief valves.. Effect of pressure and thermal stress on boiler/steam generator, moisture-separator, reheater, and turbine.. Need for boiler/steam generator control adjustment.. Generator tripping as an alternative to fast valving.. Methods, such as single-pole switching or neutral resis¬ tors to reduce frequency of fast valving operations. Depending on system characteristics, either momentary or sustained fast valving can be an effective method of stability improvement. Reliable methods of fast valving that do not compromise steam supply system and turbine availability would usually be preferred over the unit tripping alternatives. Implementation of fast valving is, however, relatively complex, involving all system components.the steam sup¬ ply system, the turbine-generator, and the electric network. Close coordination among electrical and mechanical engi¬ neers of the vendors and the utility are necessary. We hope that this paper, along with discussions, will contribute to an understanding of the benefits and limitations of the various methods of fast valving.},

Rotor angle swings of the units and the resulting system power swings under a three-phase fault and stuck breaker contingency are analyzed. The benefits of independent pole operation (IPO) breakers at the plant are evaluated from the standpoint of plant stability. Improved plant and system stability performance resulting from the successful independent pole operation of the failed breaker is demonstrated. The advantages of IPO breakers over fast turbine valving with regard to enhanced stability margins and extended critical fault clearing times are investigated. Furthermore, out-of-step protective relay schemes associated with IPO breaker applications are briefly discussed.},
